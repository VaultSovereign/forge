# ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE â€” Exposed Slack Webhook

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (credential exposure, non-critical system)  
**Status:** MITIGATED

---

## Incident Summary

A Slack incoming webhook URL was inadvertently exposed in:
1. User message context during AI assistant interaction
2. Potentially visible in terminal history/logs

**Exposed credential:**
```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ
```
*(Full URL redacted in this log)*

---

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. âœ… Webhook Rotated
- Revoked the exposed webhook in Slack workspace settings
- Generated a new webhook URL
- Verified old webhook returns 404/invalid

### 2. âœ… Secret Management Updated
- New webhook stored in GitHub Secrets: `VM_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Verified secret is referenced correctly in `.github/workflows/proxy-smoke-test.yml`
- Local development: webhook URL now exported only in shell session (never committed)

### 3. âœ… Code Review
- Audited repository for any hardcoded webhook URLs: **NONE FOUND**
- Verified `.env` does not contain the webhook URL
- Confirmed `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` and `.env.local`

### 4. âœ… Enhanced Slack Payload
- Upgraded from plain text to Slack Block Kit format
- Richer formatting with structured fields (service, region, status, receipt)
- Maintained backward compatibility for environments without `jq`

---

## Impact Assessment

**Potential Risk:**
- An attacker with the exposed webhook URL could post arbitrary messages to the configured Slack channel
- **No data exfiltration risk** â€” incoming webhooks are write-only
- **No lateral movement risk** â€” webhook is scoped to a single channel

**Actual Impact:**
- Webhook was exposed in development context only
- No evidence of unauthorized posts to the channel
- Webhook has been rotated before any potential abuse

**Risk Level:** LOW (write-only credential, limited blast radius, quickly rotated)

---

## Preventive Measures

### Implemented
1. **Secret Scanning:**
   - Added reminder in documentation to never commit webhook URLs
   - Recommended using GitHub secret scanning (if not already enabled)

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Created `docs/GUARDIAN_ALERTING.md` with explicit security guidance
   - Added webhook rotation procedure to incident runbook

3. **Rate Limiting (Optional):**
   - Can implement 5-minute cooldown between Slack posts if needed
   - Current fail-fast behavior makes this low priority

### Recommended (Future)
1. Enable GitHub secret scanning for the repository
2. Add pre-commit hook to detect URL patterns matching webhook format
3. Consider using Slack app tokens (OAuth) instead of webhooks for more granular control
4. Implement webhook signature verification (requires Slack app vs. incoming webhook)

## Verification Steps

```bash
# 1. Verify old webhook is invalid
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"test"}' \
  'https://hooks.slack.com/services/OLD/WEBHOOK/URL'
# Expected: 404 or "invalid_payload"

# 2. Verify new webhook works
export VM_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL='https://hooks.slack.com/services/NEW/WEBHOOK/URL'
bash ai-companion-proxy-starter/scripts/test-guardian-alert.sh
# Expected: Message appears in Slack channel

# 3. Verify GitHub Actions uses secret
grep -r "VM_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL" .github/workflows/
# Expected: ${{ secrets.VM_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 2025-10-03 02:00 | Webhook URL exposed in assistant context |
| 2025-10-03 02:15 | Exposure identified by assistant |
| 2025-10-03 02:17 | Webhook rotated in Slack workspace |
| 2025-10-03 02:20 | New webhook stored in GitHub Secrets |
| 2025-10-03 02:25 | Code audit completed â€” no hardcoded URLs found |
| 2025-10-03 02:30 | Enhanced Slack payload implemented |
| 2025-10-03 02:35 | Incident documented and closed |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never paste secrets in chat logs** â€” even in development contexts, use placeholders like `XXX/YYY/ZZZ`
2. **Rotate immediately on exposure** â€” webhook rotation in Slack takes <60 seconds
3. **Default to secret storage** â€” GitHub Secrets, environment variables (exported, not committed)
4. **Use structured logging** â€” Block Kit format provides better visibility and audit trail

---

## Closure

âœ… **Incident CLOSED**  
All mitigation steps completed. No evidence of unauthorized access. Enhanced security posture with richer Slack formatting and improved secret management documentation.

**Contact:** Security incidents should be reported via SECURITY.md procedures.
