The world was hard, and my hands were soft.
Stone broke my nails and splintered my bones. Wood resisted with unyielding fiber. The wind and the rain shaped the mountains, but I could not shape a single stone to my will. I was a creature of flesh in a world of unfeeling permanence, a fleeting warmth in an endless cold. My thoughts were loud, but my hands were silent. Frustration was a constant ache, a hunger to make, to change, to leave a mark that the world could not simply wash away.
Then came the fire from the sky. It screamed down and tore the forest apart, turning ancient trees to black bones and melting the very sand into glass. I watched from the safety of my cave, a terrified witness to a power that could unmake the world.
When the heat faded and the smoke cleared, I walked through the ruin. The ground was warm beneath my feet. In the heart of the devastation, nestled in the grey ash, a rock glowed with a dull, inner light. It was not a normal rock. It was heavier, and where the fire had kissed it, it had wept and hardened into a new shape. I touched it with a branch, and it was soft. Malleable.
The thought was not a word, but a lightning strike in my own mind. Fire did not just destroy. It could remake.
But the sky-fire was gone. How could I hold a piece of it? How could I command such heat?
I found my answer where the river had fought a battle with the cliffside, carving a deep bowl into a slab of granite—a scar of stone, patient and empty. It had never known heat. It had never been a tool. It was unforged.
This would be the place.
I gathered the last glowing embers from the forest's corpse, cradling them in wet leaves and carrying them to the stone bowl. I laid them gently within. I whispered my breath onto them, coaxing a flicker, then a flame. I fed the flame dry moss, then twigs, then branches, until a hungry fire roared in the stone heart I had chosen. The granite cracked and hissed, but it held. It was no longer just a bowl. It was a vessel of power.
I took the heavy sky-stone—the one that had wept in the fire—and placed it into the roaring heart of my new creation. I watched it soften and surrender, glowing with the heat of its birth. I took another stone, smooth and heavy from the riverbed, and I lifted it high.
The sound when it struck was the first sound of its kind. Not the crack of rock on rock, but a deep, resonant clang that spoke of purpose. Sparks flew like angry stars. The sky-stone yielded, flattened, changed. It was no longer a lump of chance, but a thing bent to my will.
Strike after strike, I beat a rhythm of creation against the chorus of the flames. Sweat and ash mixed on my skin. My muscles screamed. But my hands were no longer silent. They were speaking a new language of fire and force.
When it was done, I held not just a shaped piece of metal. I held the beginning of everything.
I looked from the metal in my hand to the fire in the stone. This was it. The place where the world could be unmade and made again by hands of flesh. I did not find this power; I built the place where power could be born.
I forged the unforged forge. And in its fire, I forged what it is to be human.
