# VaultMesh AI — Sovereign Compliance Automation for Financial Services

**What it is**  
A sovereign prompt orchestration platform with an immutable **Reality Ledger**. Execute compliance templates (e.g., **DORA ICT Risk**, **TPRM**) and produce audit‑ready evidence with cryptographic receipts.

**Why it wins**
- **80% cost reduction vs Big 4**; **10× speed** to evidence
- **Sovereign by design**: you run it; your keys, your data
- **Verifiable**: every action ledgered with hashes/signatures

**Core Use Cases**
- DORA ICT Risk assessment (policy, assets, controls)
- Third‑Party Risk Management (evidence‑based)
- Secrets hygiene & code security audits
- Container and CI/CD security checks

**How it works**
1. Select a template (e.g., `dora.tprm.v1`)
2. Prescan ingests evidence paths & questionnaires
3. Model executes with guardrails; schema‑validated output
4. Reality Ledger entry written (inputs, outputs, hashes)

**Outputs**
- Structured JSON reports (e.g., findings, coverage, acceptance)
- Immutable audit receipts; verifiable offline

**Pricing (starter anchors)**
- Ops templates: **€299–€499/year** per template
- DORA templates: **€7K–€24K/year** per template
- Enterprise bundles: **€30K–€300K/year** depending on scope

**ROI (illustrative)**
- Replace a €250k annual manual program with a €50k bundle → **€200k/year savings**, time‑to‑evidence cut from weeks to hours.

**Pilot**
- **1 week** to first compliant report using your real evidence.
- Success criteria: zero critical gaps, repeatable runbooks, sign‑off by Compliance.
